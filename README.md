Jira add-on to visualize dependencies between issues.


## Goal
The goal of this fork is to create a viable Free and Open-Source version alternative to Issue-Link Graph Visualization Add-ons such as Vivid Trace.

### Why?
Since there was a project out there that already does most of the work and was mentioned by a Twitter Tech blog, I thought I would carry it to completion. Especially since Vivid Trace isn't really great either.

## Features to be implemented in this Fork
The following features should bring it to parity with Vivid Trace
- Project Panel View
- Hover mouse over node to view title of issue
- Click on Node to go to Issue
- Remove a lot of the controls for Enabling naming on Edges and Inward vs. Outward, and just have there be a default that shows everything.

## Version Support
Because of when the fork was made, I've removed support for JIRA 4.x.x and JIRA 5.x.x
Currently the build is targetting JIRA 6.4, but I'm open to keeping it compatible with the entire JIRA 6.x range.
